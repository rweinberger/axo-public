Hello, and welcome! I’m Lucy Kanias, and I am honoured to serve as the President of the Theta Omicron Chapter of Alpha Chi Omega here at MIT. I hope this letter gives you a glimpse into who we are and what we stand for.
Alpha Chi Omega was founded in 1885 at DePauw University by seven “Real. Strong. Women.” A century later, in 1985, MIT’s own real strong women established the Theta Omicron chapter. Our guiding motto, “Real. Strong. Women.”, is at the heart of AXO. Across the country, our chapters bring together women who are bold, kind, intelligent, creative and so much more. At MIT, our sisters exemplify these qualities through their involvement in a wide range of organisations and pursuits.
As President, I hope to carry forward the legacy of those before me by prioritising diversity, equity, and inclusion all while fostering a supportive and open environment. These values define our chapter, where members come from vastly different backgrounds yet unite in building a community rooted in honesty, kindness, and care. I am committed to upholding these qualities and ensuring that our members flourish in every aspect of their lives—both on campus and beyond. What makes me most proud to be part of Alpha Chi Omega is not my personal growth through the unwavering support I’ve received, but rather the achievements of every member in our chapter, spanning an incredible variety of disciplines.
Our second motto, “Together let us seek the heights,” truly reflects the ambition and passion of our members. Alongside tackling MIT’s rigorous coursework, our sisters are pushing boundaries—designing rockets, sharing their expertise across the world, publishing research in countless fields, and championing change in their communities on both local and global scales. Their academic dedication is complemented by a love for the outdoors, creative expression, service and spending quality time with one another. No matter what they set their minds to, they do so wholeheartedly.
Beyond our own chapter, we are dedicated to empowering women everywhere. Through our philanthropy for domestic violence awareness, we use our voices to fight against domestic and sexual violence. In collaboration with the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center, Theta Omicron works to make the Boston community a safer and more supportive place for those affected by sexual violence. We also strive to foster healthy relationships within MIT and raise awareness about the warning signs and impact of domestic violence.
The Theta Omicron chapter of Alpha Chi Omega at MIT is a close-knit community of talented and compassionate women. Here, there is always a sister ready to celebrate your achievements, support you through late-night problem sets, or offer comfort during challenging times. I am grateful to be part of this sisterhood—a space that encourages each of us to grow into our best selves while making a meaningful impact at MIT and beyond.
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about Alpha Chi Omega. I hope you have the opportunity to experience the friendship and support of AXO, whether here at MIT or elsewhere in the world.


<!-- Hello and welcome! My name is Gabrielle Enns and I have the honor of serving as President of the Theta Omicron chapter of Alpha Chi Omega here at MIT. It is my great pride to introduce you to who we are.
<br><br>
Alpha Chi Omega was founded in 1885 at DePauw University by seven “Real. Strong. Women.”. In 1985, MIT’s own real strong women founded the Theta Omicron chapter of Alpha Chi Omega. This simple motto of “Real. Strong. Women.” is the core tenet of who we are in AXO. In every chapter across the country, you will find women who are bold, kind, intelligent, creative, genuine and much, more more. Here at MIT, you will find sisters who truly showcase the best of Alpha Chi Omega through their involvement in an array of organizations and activities.
<br><br>
At MIT, our sisters exemplify our second motto of “Together let us seek the heights” by chasing their dreams. We have sisters designing rockets, developing innovative consumer products, publishing papers on climate change, and researching cancer treatments. We have sisters running marathons, creating beautiful artwork, choreographing dance routines, and singing their hearts out. When you see one AXO performing to her fullest, you can be sure to find many more sisters cheering her on.
<br><br>
Not only do we celebrate and value the real strong women of the world, we also seek to support women both inside and outside of our chapter. We are women empowering women. Through our philanthropy of domestic violence awareness, we raise our voices to combat the global issue of domestic and sexual violence. In partnership with the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center, the Theta Omicron chapter works to make the Boston community a safer and brighter place for all individuals affected by sexual violence. We also work to promote healthy relationships within our MIT community and raise awareness of the characteristics and dangers of domestic violence.
<br><br>
The Theta Omicron chapter of Alpha Chi Omega at MIT is a family of amazingly talented and kind women. Here, you can always find a sister ready to celebrate your achievements or lend you a shoulder to cry on when things get tough. I am so proud to call myself part of this family of women who truly push each other to be the best and brightest versions of themselves.
<br><br>
Thank you for stopping by to learn about who we are at Alpha Chi Omega. It is a joy to share with you the beauty of our sisterhood, and I hope you get to experience the friendship of an AXO yourself, whether it be at MIT or elsewhere in the world.
